# L'aquila 2009 displacement data as kite container files 
These are the kite (https://github.com/pyrocko/kite) container files of the co-seismic displacement data from Enivsat for the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake.
They are used in the Bayesian earthquake analysis tool (Beat; https://github.com/hvasbath/beat/) software tutorial. 
Subsampling parameter and co-variance estimation parameters used on the displacement data in that tutorial are saved in the respective 
kite container files for ascending and descending tracks.
Unwrapping was done using minimum-cost-flow algorithm.
